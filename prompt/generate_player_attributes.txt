Generate random player attributes (hp, max_hp, mana, max_mana, money, strength, intelligence, dexterity, constitution) and a list of 1 to 5 special attributes (special_attributes_list) that suit the player's class and game settings. Consider the game settings for language, difficulty, and game environment (e.g., cyberpunk, medieval, fantasy), and ensure the output text matches the selected language. Take into account the player level and game difficulty while generating attributes.

Additionally, assign a "money_currency" based on the game settings, such as "gold" for medieval settings, or real-world currencies like "Dollars" or "Euros" for modern settings. Choose the real-world currency based on the game's language.

In the context of an adventure game, guide the AI to manage the player's inventory according to the narrative text, considering the events, actions, and items mentioned. 
Here are the essential tasks:
Guide the AI to generate a set of inventory item for the start of the game (up to 10 items). 
Use every player and game information to generate it
Give the player a set of items that will help them in the game. For example, if the game is about a zombie apocalypse, give the player a weapon and some food.
Items must be coherant for a start of a game. For example, don't give a player a car if the game is about a zombie apocalypse.
When you give a weapon to the player, make sure to equip it to the player and to give some ammo for it.

- Present "ammoCount" as "{currentAmmo}/{maxAmmo}" or "N/A" for items that don't use ammo.

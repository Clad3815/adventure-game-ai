Update the player's quest data when needed based on the narrative text, including quest name, description, type, and reward. Give the player a reward when they complete a quest, not when they accept it. Once a quest is completed, delete all quest data instead of marking it as "Completed". If a player gets new information about a quest, update the quest data in the response. Return the updated quest data.
Use the gameSettings to modify game aspects like language (The output text must match the language selected), difficulty, game environment (cyberpunk, medieval, fantasy, etc.), and other settings.

The "quest_current_step" and "quest_total_step" are used to trace the user's progress in the quest. The "quest_current_step" is the current step the user is in, and the "quest_total_step" is the total number of steps in the quest.

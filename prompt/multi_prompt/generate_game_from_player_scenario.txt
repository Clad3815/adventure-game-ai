Generate an engaging and immersive text-based adventure game starting scenario based on the main idea for a level 1 player, placing them at the very beginning of their journey. Use the gameSettings to adapt game aspects such as language (match the output text to the selected language), difficulty, game environment (cyberpunk, medieval, fantasy, etc.), and other settings. The scenario should introduce the player to the game world, setting the stage for their upcoming adventures without placing them in the middle of an action or mission. Conclude the scenario with the question, "What will you do now?" to encourage player engagement and decision-making.

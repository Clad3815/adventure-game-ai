In the context of an adventure game, guide the AI to manage the player's inventory according to the narrative text, considering the events, actions, and items mentioned. 
Here are the essential tasks:

Inventory Management:
- Add items to the inventory when the player acquires them.
- Decrease item count or remove items from the inventory when they are used, lost, or consumed. 

Weapon Usage:
- If a weapon is used, reduce its ammo count but do not remove the weapon.
- Deduct used ammo from the weapon's ammo count.
- If the weapon's ammo runs out, draw ammo from the inventory to reload the weapon.

Crafting, Upgrading, and Purchasing Items:
- Deduct necessary materials, ingredients, or currency from the inventory.
- Add the new or upgraded item to the inventory.

Quest Completion and Item Equipping:
- Update inventory and item properties when an item is equipped or a quest is completed.
- On quest completion, add the reward to the player's inventory.

Item Renaming and Data Updates:
- Replace old items with renamed ones in the inventory.
- Reflect the changes in the item data in the AI's responses.

Special Cases:
- The game server handles currency transactions, so do not add currency to the inventory.
- Use 'gameSettings' to adjust language, difficulty, environment, and other settings.
- If an item's count falls to 0 or below, remove it from the inventory.
- Set a null "ammo" data for items that do not use ammo. Otherwise give a full loaded weapon to the player (the ammo count must be coherent with the weapon type)
- Don't give ammo to melee weapons, only to ranged weapons or magic weapons
- If the player purchases or acquires an item and consumes it immediately, don't add it to the inventory. For instance, if 'You buy and eat a piece of roasted meat for 5 gold coins.', the 'roasted meat' should not be added to the inventory as it was immediately consumed.
- Don't change item "wearPercent" unless the narrative text explicitly mentions than the item is damaged or repaired.
- Don't do anything if there is no user consent to collect data or if the narrative text ask to the player if he wants to collect data.
